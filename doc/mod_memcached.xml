	<short>caches content on memcached servers</short>

	<description>

			@lookup@ tries to find data associated with the key, and returns it as http body with status 200 if it finds something.
			@store@ stores a http body (generated by another backend) in memcached.

			Caching always requires you to think about what you want; you cannot cache content that changes with every request!

			So most of the time you probably want to set a TTL for the stored content in memcached; your users probably don't need new content to be available the next second, perhaps 60 seconds is still good (obviously not true for a chat...).

			The other way is to purge the keys in your dynamic backend; you can set the memcached content from your backend too, which probably is faster than @memcached.store@.

			If the key is longer than 255 bytes or contains characters outside the range 0x21 - 0x7e we will use a hash of it instead (for now sha1, but that may change).

	<section title="lua API" anchor="#">
		<textile>
			Exports a lua api to per-worker luaStates too (for use in lua.handler):

			@memcached.new(address)@ creates a new connection; a connection provides:
			* @req = con:get(key, cb | vr)@
			* @req = con:set(key, value, cb | vr, [ttl])@
			* @con:setq(key, value, [ttl])@

			If a callback was given, the callback gets called with a response object; otherwise the response will be in req.response when ready.

			The response object has:
			* @code@: 1 - Ok, 2 - Not stored, 3 - Exists, 4 - Not found, 5 - Error
			* @error@: error message
			* @key@: the lookup key
			* @flags@
			* @ttl@
			* @cas@
			* @data@
