	<short>requires authentication from clients using a username and password. It supports the basic (digest not yet) authentication method as well as plaintext, htpasswd and htdigest backends.</short>

	<description>
		<textile>
			*IMPORTANT NOTE*: You need to put the auth actions before generating content! If a content handler is already active (like php or static or dirlist), auth will be ignored!

			* Basic:
			  The "basic" method transfers the username and the password in cleartext over the network (base64 encoded) and might result in security problems if not used in conjunction with an encrypted communication channel between client and server.
			  It is recommend to use https in conjunction with basic authentication.

			* Digest (not supported yet):
			  The "digest" method only transfers a hashed value over the network which performs a lot of work to harden the authentication process in insecure networks (like the internet).
			  The "digest" method doesn't work with the htpasswd backend, only with plaintext and htdigest.

			*NOTE*: The digest method is broken in Internet Explorer &lt; 7. Use basic instead if this is a problem for you. (not supported for now anyway)
